### Test & Continuous Integration Setup for EpicChain

Maintaining code quality and ensuring the reliability of EpicChain is critical to the project's success. The test suite plays a key role in this by allowing developers to run automated tests both manually and automatically. With each push to the codebase, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/epicchain/epicchain-cli) automatically runs the test suite to verify that new changes do not introduce any regressions or issues. 

#### Running Tests Manually

For developers who want to run tests locally before pushing changes, the process is straightforward. First, make sure you have [Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) installed on your machine. Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment, ensuring that tests run the same way on every developer's machine and in the CI pipeline.

Once Docker is installed, you can run the tests from any bash-compatible shell, such as Git Bash on Windows, by executing the following command:

```bash
./ci/build-and-test.sh
```

This script will handle the entire process of building and testing the project within a Docker container, simulating the exact steps that Travis CI will perform in the automated pipeline. This makes it easy to catch potential issues early, in the same environment that the CI system will use.

#### What the Test Suite Does

The test suite is designed to be comprehensive, covering all critical aspects of the EpicChain codebase. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Building the Code:** The latest version of the EpicChain code is compiled to ensure that there are no build errors and that the code integrates correctly with the dependencies.

2. **Functional Verification with expect:** The core functionality of the `epicchain-cli` command-line interface is verified using an [expect](https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect) script. This scripting tool automates interactions with programs that require user input, enabling the test suite to simulate user behavior and verify that the CLI responds as expected.

3. **JSON-RPC Testing with curl:** JSON-RPC is a critical protocol for interacting with EpicChain, and the test suite uses `curl` to send requests and validate the responses. This ensures that the API endpoints are functioning correctly and that the data returned is as expected.

#### Detailed Explanation of Key Files

The following files are essential to the test and continuous integration process:

- **`Dockerfile`:** This file defines the Docker image used to build and test `epicchain-cli`. It specifies the operating system, dependencies, and build tools needed to create a reliable and consistent environment for running the tests. By using a Docker container, we eliminate discrepancies between different development environments, ensuring that tests are performed in an identical setup every time.

- **`build-and-test.sh`:** This script is the entry point for running the test suite. It builds the Docker image defined in the `Dockerfile`, starts the Docker container, and runs the test commands inside the container. This script is especially useful for developers who want to test changes on their local machines before pushing code to the repository. Running this script locally will give you confidence that your changes will pass the CI pipeline.

- **`run-tests-in-docker.sh`:** Once inside the Docker container, this script is executed to run the actual tests. It is designed to be simple yet effective, executing the various test scripts and capturing their output for analysis. By separating this script from the `build-and-test.sh` script, we maintain a clear distinction between setting up the test environment and running the tests themselves.

- **`test-epicchain-cli.expect`:** This is the [expect](https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect) script that automates the interaction with the `epicchain-cli` command-line tool. It simulates a user's input and checks the output to verify that the tool behaves correctly. This script is crucial for testing command-line functionalities, ensuring that commands execute as expected and produce the correct results.

#### Continuous Integration Benefits

By integrating the test suite with Travis CI, we ensure that every code push is automatically tested, providing immediate feedback to developers. This automated process catches issues early, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into the codebase and ensuring that only high-quality code is merged. Additionally, the consistent use of Docker for testing guarantees that the code is always tested in a clean environment, free from the peculiarities of individual developers' setups.

This setup not only improves code quality but also speeds up the development process by allowing developers to focus on writing code, confident that any issues will be caught by the automated tests. As a result, the EpicChain project can continue to evolve rapidly while maintaining a high level of stability and reliability.
