# EpicChain Node README

Welcome to the EpicChain Node! This document provides comprehensive instructions for setting up, compiling, and using the EpicChain Node software. Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth installation and operation of your node.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the correct environment for running the EpicChain Node:

- **Operating Systems:** 
  - **Windows**
  - **Linux** (Ubuntu 14 and 16 are supported; Ubuntu 17 is not supported)
  - **Mac** (If you are using a Mac, please use a virtual machine to run a supported version of Linux)

### Install .NET Core

EpicChain Node requires .NET Core to run. Please download and install the latest version of [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) suitable for your operating system. This runtime environment is essential for executing the EpicChain Node application.

### Install Required Packages

#### On Linux

For Linux users, particularly those running Ubuntu 14 or 16, you need to install several development packages required for EpicChain Node:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Execute the following command to install LevelDB and SQLite3 development libraries:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libleveldb-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libunwind8-dev
   ```

   This command will download and install the necessary libraries that EpicChain Node depends on for data storage and management.

#### On Windows

If you are using Windows, you will need a specific version of LevelDB designed for EpicChain. Please download it from the following link:

- [EpicChain Version of LevelDB](https://github.com/xmoohad/leveldb)

Follow the instructions on the LevelDB GitHub page to properly install and integrate it into your system.

### Running EpicChain CLI

After installing the necessary components, you can start the EpicChain CLI (Command Line Interface) application. Open a command prompt or terminal and execute the following command:

```sh
dotnet epicchain-cli.dll
```

This command starts the EpicChain Node application, allowing you to interact with the blockchain and perform various operations.

## Compile from Source

If you prefer to compile EpicChain Node from source, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, you need to clone the `epicchain-cli` repository from GitHub. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/xmoohad/epicchain-cli.git
   ```

   Navigate into the cloned directory:

   ```sh
   cd epicchain-cli
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies and Build**

   With the repository cloned, restore the required dependencies and compile the application. Execute the following commands:

   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

   These commands will restore the necessary packages and build the project in release mode, preparing it for production use.

3. **.NET Core SDK**

   Ensure that you have version 1.1.2 of the .NET Core SDK installed on your system. If you need to download it, use the [SDK binary](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux) provided on the .NET Core website.

   After downloading and extracting the .NET SDK, you can run the compiled application with:

   ```sh
   ../dotnet bin/Release/net8.0/epicchain-cli.dll .
   ```

   Adjust the path if necessary to match where you extracted the .NET SDK.

## Usage

Once your EpicChain Node is set up and running, you can use it to perform various operations. Below are some basic commands to get you started:

- **Show Node State**

  To check the current state of your EpicChain Node, use the following command:

  ```sh
  epicchain-cli.dll show state
  ```

  This command provides detailed information about the nodeâ€™s current status, including blockchain synchronization, active connections, and more.

- **Create a New Wallet**

  To create a new wallet for managing your EpicChain assets, execute:

  ```sh
  epicchain-cli.dll create wallet wallet.db3
  ```

  Replace `wallet.db3` with the desired name for your wallet file. This command generates a new wallet database file, which will be used to store your blockchain assets securely.
